This file contains code for implementing our analysis from the manuscript "Quantitative Evaluation of Gating Methods for High-Dimensional Mass Cytometry Data: Manual Gating, Unsupervised Clustering, and Auto-Gating."

Some unsupervised methods do not have R/Python packages. To implement these methods, please visit their respective websites to download the tools and follow their tutorials.

If you have questions about the code in this repository or issues implementing the analysis, contact me at rick.chang@pitt.edu.
